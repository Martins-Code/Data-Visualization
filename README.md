## Dataset

> With 16 feature variables, including trip duration and start and end times, this dataset contains 183412 occurrences of journeys across the San Francisco Bay area. This dataset only includes travel cases for the month of February in 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> Male Subscribers 20 to 40 years old who don't utilize the bike share for all service are the demographic that generates the most money for the company. People of the "other" gender who use the bike-share-for-all service and are Subscriber type generate the least revenue. Although there are more subscribers than customers, customers spend more time riding (an average of about 20mins compared to about 10mins of Subscriber type)


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Since subscribers go farther less frequently than customers, they rent bikes more effectively.
In comparison to their journeys during other days of the week, both User types' weekend trips last less time.
